      "My current progress in Nand2Tetris, a course that has you creating a modern computer starting with a simple NAND gate.

Then proceeding through writing an Assembler to translate Assembly to Machine Code. Following that, writing a VM Translator to Assembly. And further beyond that, writing a compiler for a Java-like OOP language for translating into the intermediary VM Language. Current progress: final step of writing the OS for the computer.",
